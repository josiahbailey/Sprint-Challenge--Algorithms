#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(log n)
    this algorithm is smaller than O(n) because a+n*n will catch up to n * n * n very quickly even on large inputs it may only take 10 loops
    this is still larger than O(1) however which is why it is O(log n)


b)O(n log n)
    this algorithm will run its first for loop in O(n) however it has an internal while loop that runs the same ammount of time each loop
    added ontop of it. Because j * 2 will = n in 1/2n this can't be considered O(n^2)


c)O(n)
    this algorithm will run for the number of bunnies regardless of the number
